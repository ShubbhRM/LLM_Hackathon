## Kaggle Competitions:
- [**Shopee - Price Match Guarantee:**](https://www.kaggle.com/c/shopee-product-matching)
 We often find online retail companies offering recommendations in which they promote their products in such a way that customers tend to get swayed and pick a similar product that is priced lower. Two pictures of similar products may appear visually identical, but they might actually represent different products. This Kaggle competition aims to avoid misrepresentation and reduce marketplace spam.

- [**Tabular Playground Series - March 2021:**](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tabular-playground-series-mar-2021)
Tabular Playground Series entails synthetic data based on real data, which revolves around predicting the amount of an insurance claim. The competition data is generated using CTGAN.

- [**Women in Data Science (WiDS) Datathon 2021:**](https://www.kaggle.com/c/widsdatathon2021)
The competition data includes several patient records from the first 24 hours of intensive care that are to be used, in order to determine whether the patient admitted has been diagnosed with a particular type of diabetes.
